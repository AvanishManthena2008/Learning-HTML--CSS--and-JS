      <p id="section2title">Section 1<br> Early Childhood</p>
      <p id="section2text">I was born in Warangal, India on September 12th 2008. I was born into a Telugu-speaking middle class family. My parents and I eventually moved to Hyderabad and we stayed there until we immigrated to Hyderabad. Growing up, my parents made sure to do everything in their power to make me smart. From late nights memorizing multiplication tables, to early mornings preparing for tests. This eventually layed the foundation for me to be a good student even until today.</p>
